Then transfer the data of nested python dictionaries into a pandas data frame. The data frame contains the geographical coordinate of NYC neighborhoods and will be used to get the venue's data from Foursquare. Lastly, we used geopy and folium libraries to create a map of NYC with neighborhoods superimposed on top. \n\nThe Foursquare API will help to explore more about NYC. Using the explore function, it will list the most common venue categories in each neighborhood. I set the limit to 5. It listed as the first common venue to the 5th common venue. We are going to use the data to analyze and decide what kind of restruarnat should be open in each different neighborhood. "
